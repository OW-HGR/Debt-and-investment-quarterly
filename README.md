# Debt and investment series

## Convert the MHCLG debt and investment series into a consistent time series

This series gives the ammount of debt each LA holds from various categories of lender (PWLB, banks, bonds etc), and their investments in various categories. Figures are for the stock at the end of the observation period rather than the flow within the period.

Unusually, the scope is England, Scotland, Wales, and NI. 

The series is annual from 2008-09 to 2015-16, and then quarterly from Q3 2016-17. Figures 

This workflow applies the long data procedure described [here](https://github.com/OW-HGR/Capital-spending-outturn-2) to the MHCLG debt and investment series.
